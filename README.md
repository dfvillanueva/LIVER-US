# LIVER-US

This repository contains liver ultrasound images from a longitudinal study entitled **"Early CANcer Detection in the LivEr of Filipinos with Chronic Hepatitis B using AI-driven Integration of Clinical and Genomic Biomarkers (CANDLE Study)"**. Liver ultrasound images were collected from 588 Filipino cohorts from December 2019 to February 2023 and were provided by our partner testing facility.

This repository is organized based on the two detection scenarios adopted in our study: (1) abnormal liver disease (ALD) and (2) fatty liver disease (FLD) detection.
